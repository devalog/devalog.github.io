The worst book I read recently was *Lady Chatterley's Lover*, which provoked a [landmark obscenity trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Penguin_Books_Ltd) in the UK in 1960. Some critics think D.H. Lawrence's writing style was influenced by his tuberculosis, which he died from two years after publishing *Lady Chatterley's Lover*. Apparently, tuberculosis can cause a heightened emotional state and also impotence, which matches up pretty well to my personal beef with the book: I found the prose insufferably flowery and the characters flat and annoying.

The best book I read recently was probably *Passing* by Nella Larsen. The book was so tense and readable and concise. *Klara and the Sun* was good too â€“ I like speculative fiction that has disorienting, unobtrusive world-building, where the reader has to figure out over the course of many pages how exactly the setting relates to present-day Earth. *Klara and the Sun* did that really well.
