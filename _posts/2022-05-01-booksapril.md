...in chronological order.

# #1: *The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories* by Sarah Orne Jewett

This book is a novella (*The Country of the Pointed Firs*) and a collection of short stories. Every story in the book takes place on the coast of Maine in the late 1800s. With a few exceptions, the stories are almost all about widowed or single women above the age of 50. There's not much drama or even plot â€“ the stories are about everyday life and the conversations the main characters have with their friends and neighbors. It was a really nice read.

# #2: *Brooklyn* by Colm Toibin

*Brooklyn* is an old favorite that I've read multiple times before. Eilis's ambivalence around many of the decisions she makes really struck me this time, as did her commitment to love despite that ambivalence.

# #3: *Conversations with Friends* by Sally Rooney

I read this book, for the third time, in anticipation of the miniseries that's coming out in a few weeks. I liked it just alright this time around. I found myself getting much more annoyed at with the characters and their lack of communication this read. Does this just mean I'm getting older?
