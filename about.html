        I'm comfortable developing and documenting code in Java, Python, C, and C++. I have working knowledge of HTML and CSS,
        which I used to build this website. I've used XML and DITA
        to create and edit technical documentation.

        I'm familiar with a number of different tools. On the development side, I've worked with
        Android Studio, Eclipse, GitHub, and Subversion. On the documentation side, I've worked with
        Oxygen XML Editor, Microsoft Visio, Snagit, JIRA, Bugzilla, and GitHub. I'm also comfortable in a
        UNIX environment.

        I'm not currently looking for a job â€“ I'm very excited to be starting with Google in a few months.
        Still, I'd love to talk with you if you're interested in my background! Download my detailed
