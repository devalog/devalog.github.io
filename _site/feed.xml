I chose this specific book to be my foray into Trollope because it was a standalone book (not part of a larger series like the Chronicles of Barsetshire) and the plot seemed similar to the kind of stuff I already like in Victorian literature (basically, marriage plot with a twist). While I’m glad I read the book and enjoyed parts of it, I found it overlong and depressingly patriarchal. I’m honestly surprised by the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/469232.The_Claverings">rave reviews on Goodreads</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Claverings</em> was initially serialized in Cornhill magazine from 1866-1867. I’ve read a lot of books that were originally serialized, but this one felt especially overlong. It contained lots of plot recaps and unnecessary plot filler.</p>

<p>In the book, Henry (called Harry – why is Harry a nickname for Henry? The name and nickname are the same length!) Clavering is the son of a well-off clergyman, whose parish abuts Clavering Park. Clavering Park is owned by Harry’s cousin Hugh Clavering, a baronet.</p>

<p>In the first few pages of the book, Harry is jilted by his fiancee Julia Brabazon. Julia instead marries the very rich Lord Ongar. Harry moons about for a while (“I will never love again!”) and then starts a sort of apprenticeship at a civil engineering firm in Stratton. Interestingly, he’s considered too good for this type of work, and many characters remark that Harry should be a clergyman or academic instead. Harry lives with his employer Mr. Burton and eventually becomes engaged to his daughter Florence Burton, a Very Good Woman. He’s over his heartbreak and everything is moving along nicely! Of course, that’s when the book really begins – Lord Ongar dies and Julia is once again unattached, but now she’s a tragic (and rich) figure as her husband was a Bad Man. But really, she suffers because she was so gauche as to marry for money instead of love. Contemporary readers apparently loved this moral lesson, and felt if anything, Julia should suffer more. Reading <em>The Claverings</em> today, Julia’s punishment feels overwrought and unnecessary.</p>

<p>After the death of her husband, Julia arrives back in England and, of course, desperately needs Harry’s assistance. Harry is conveniently in London at this point, working for Burton’s London branch. Harry falls back in love with Julia (and her wealth) and is on the verge of breaking off his engagement to Florence, but he’s terribly indecisive about the whole thing. At this point, Florence’s sister-in-law Cecilia Burton takes things into her own hands. (“No one liked success better than Cecilia Burton, and to her success would consist in rescuing Harry from Lady Ongar and securing him for Florence”) She’s conveniently living in London, while Florence remains in Stratton. Cecelia Burton is another Very Good Woman and Harry admires her a lot (for good reason, she’s initially great). However, she goes to great lengths to shield Florence from the full truth of Harry’s waffling and obsession with Julia and pressures Harry to keep his engagement. Florence is too good for Harry. This is a fact acknowledged by Cecilia. But from pretty much everyone’s view, this just means that Harry should man up and honor the engagement. There’s no talk about Florence cutting her losses and finding someone who will be faithful to her. (At times, it seems like Florence herself would actually prefer this route.) This seems to have something to do with Harry’s higher (than the Burtons) social status. Cecilia, and pretty much everyone in the book, is a little too obsessed with Harry’s happiness and finding out what exactly will make him the most happy.</p>

<p>Julia, even, is the same way. She is still in love with Harry but thinks he will be happier with Florence. Will he? Maybe? But Julia is actually very nice too and there’s no obvious reason why Harry and Julia wouldn’t be very happy together. Harry eventually ends up with Florence, but there’s a certain amount of resignation in his decision. It’s the easier decision that’s supported (and maneuvered) by his family and Florence’s family, and Florence is really very nice. Harry is rewarded for choosing love (is it really love, though?) over wealth (as represented by Julia): after the untimely (timely?) deaths of some key characters, Harry’s father is the new baronet and Harry is his heir. He’s set for life and never has to work again.</p>

<p>One subplot that I found at turns interesting and sad was Harry’s sister Fanny Clavering’s courtship by Mr. Saul, a poor and extremely unsuitable (according to Fanny and Harry’s father) clergyman. Saul lives in poverty so he can give more to his parish. He truly cares for Fanny and they meet doing good works in the neighborhood. Saul proposes to Fanny suddenly, taking her by surprise. He takes advantage of her genuine liking for him and manipulates her into accepting his proposal – the implication is she’s not a true Christian unless she marries him. It feels like Saul sees Fanny as the ideal wife (this isn’t not true), and because he wants it, he will get it, regardless of how Fanny feels. He thinks he knows better and that Fanny is just confused and indecisive. They marry, of course, and Fanny and Saul both seem very pleased. Even though her family initially disapproves, marrying Saul is in many ways the path of least resistance, just like Harry.</p>

<p>I’d like to read more Trollope, but as it stands there are many other Victorian novels that I find much better than <em>The Claverings.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years and years of seeing Trollope books in used bookstores and being like “I should read those someday,” I finally read The Claverings in October 2024.

This page does not cover the<a href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/apps"> Kobo app</a>, another tool you can use to check out books to both the app and your e-reader.</p>

<h1 id="background-overdrive-and-the-libra-h2o-model">Background: OverDrive and the Libra H2O model</h1>

<p>The Kobo Libra H2O is a discontinued Rakuten Kobo model that is <a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019690433-Products-no-longer-manufactured-or-supported-by-Kobo">still supported by Kobo.</a></p>

<p>OverDrive is a digital platform that distributes library content to e-readers. Using OverDrive, you can directly access your library account on the Libra H2O and other e-readers. OverDrive also makes the Libby app, which <a href="https://company.overdrive.com/2021/08/09/important-update-regarding-libby-and-the-overdrive-app/">replaced the OverDrive platform functionality</a> on some Kobo models in 2023. However, OverDrive (not Libby) is still the only way to connect to your library directly from the Libra H2O model without using the Kobo iOS or Android app. Unlike newer Kobo e-readers, OverDrive is built directly into the Kobo Libra H2O so it’s not impacted by the Libby update. You aren’t able to download Libby or any other app directly onto the Libra H2O.</p>

<h2 id="switching-overdrive-accounts">Switching OverDrive accounts</h2>

<p>You might have multiple OverDrive accounts with different library systems. This might be the case if you’re a student and have library accounts with your school and your town. It’s also common to have multiple accounts if you reside in multiple places over the course of a year or have recently moved. When you’re using the Libra H2O model, you can only be logged into a single OverDrive account at any given time, but you can manually switch between accounts.</p>

<p>To switch accounts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to the <strong>OverDrive</strong> menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select <strong>Remove</strong> to log out of your library account. Then, follow the instructions in <a href="?tab=t.0#heading=h.42klufn99hm1">Getting started with OverDrive</a> to add a new library account. The Libra H2O won’t save any previous login information so if you want to switch back to your previous account, you must reupload your library card details.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: Switching OverDrive accounts only affects the books you have checked out with that library card. It doesn’t affect any books you have purchased or downloaded directly to your device.</p>

<h2 id="other-ways-to-add-books">Other ways to add books</h2>

<p>If a book you want to read isn’t available on OverDrive, you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Buy it via the Kobo catalog. Before you buy an individual book, look into Kobo’s <a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002747873-Kobo-Super-Points">membership options</a>. It might be a better deal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download it. If you are located in the United States and you want to check out a book from before 1929, you may want to find a downloadable public domain copy of the book instead of checking it out from the library so you aren’t subject to the time limits of a library book. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a> has a robust catalog of public domain ebooks.</p>

It took me two weeks to read the first 60 pages before I decided to call it quits.  I’ve read reviews that call Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop “<a href="https://catherinerosegunther.com/2023/12/16/review-welcome-to-the-hyunam-dong-bookshop-by-hwang-bo-reum/">comforting</a>” and “<a href="https://judithmckinnon.com/2024/09/29/book-review-welcome-to-the-hyunam-dong-bookshop-by-huang-bo-reum-a-novel-about-new-beginnings-friendship-and-reading/">gentle</a>” but I just found it boring. Everything felt too long, too clique, and too general. I read some reviews that mention that the characters’ backstories are revealed later. I’ve read books where that progressive revelation really works, but here I just wasn’t compelled enough to stick around for the reveal.</p>

<p>Empty cliques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If more people read, I think the world would become a better place” (39)</li>
  <li>“Being so busy, we’re usually left with only small pockets of time to read – perha[s in the morning, during lunch, in the evening after work and before we go to bed. But these pockets of time can add up to become something substantial” (39).</li>
</ul>

<p>Awkward sentences that feel mistranslated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The footfall soon trickled to a drop” (5)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overlong, too much explanation, so generic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If independent bookshops sprouting up on street corners and in alleyways was a trend, then the same could be said of such bookshops turning into cultural spaces. For the latter, it wasn’t like booksellers were jumping on the bandwagon just because it was the trendy thing to do. Hosting events was a business strategy–they had to attract a crowd to boost sales; bookshops couldn’t survive by just selling books” (35)</li>
  <li>“Minjun didn’t hate it. In fact, he found himself wanting to listen to her for a couple more hours after work, over a beer or something. As to why he would feel this way, he thought about it and concluded that perhaps if he was able to listen to someone rant for a few hours, he would also eventually be able to articulate his own struggles. For the first time, he was acutely aware of how lonely he’d been for a long time” (45).</li>
</ul>

<p>This book felt like it was trying to be a novel, a memoir about running a bookstore, and an encouraging self-help book. I would be interested in reading any one of these individual things. Smooshed all together, though, it wasn’t any of these things. This wasn’t a book I wanted to continue.</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited to read Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop because I thought the premise (woman quits high-stress job to run a bookshop) was fun and cute.

It’s my third book by Korelitz; I’ve also read <em>The Latecomer</em> and <em>The Plot</em>. Both of these books feel like the best kind of literary fiction – they’re long, but not just long. They’re expansive but not overlong, long enough so I can really relax and revel in the story, but not boring at all. They take their time building up the circumstances and plot, and going into the backstories of characters, and then things start to unravel and build and it’s great! I found both of these books so satisfying to read and expected something similar from <em>Admission</em>.</p>

<p>I got that, in part. <em>Admission</em> starts out like you’d expect a romantic drama to start out – a tension-filled meet-cute followed by a night of passion – but then it doesn’t continue in that thread. It turns and begins that expansive backstory-exploring, worldbuilding kind of writing that I loved in <em>The Latecomer</em> and <em>The Plot</em>. Portia’s life as an admissions officer is revealed, her past life is hinted at and slowly unraveled, and the circumstances just build and build. Admissions season ramps up, Portia’s mother takes in a pregnant teenager, Portia’s relationship falls apart, Portia’s secret from her past bubbles up into the present. Everything builds separately and together and it’s gripping but you can’t figure out just why these things that are one step off from mundane are so gripping? But at some point, it becomes too heavy-handed and there are just too many coincidences. Multiple characters who meet by chance end up being deeply connected through past events, and some of this just feels forced.</p>

<p>I also felt that while the book initially promised a nuanced take on multiple subjects and then didn’t deliver. Many people in the book think admission to Princeton is the be-all, end-all. Portia is frustrated at these people’s shallowness of thought. But at the end of the day, admission to Princeton is the pinnacle of one character’s achievement, and granting that admission is the pinnacle of Portia’s, the best thing she can do, the thing she can do to make up for other things she didn’t do. The nuance got flattened.</p>

<p>There are multiple storylines about unintended pregnancies in <em>Admission</em>. (I count… four?! Is that too many for one book?) The book explores the topic of parenting or not parenting a child and disrupted relationships with children in what starts as a nuanced way. But the end message is straightforward: giving up your child is never the right thing to do; and a child growing up without one or both parents will always pine for the missing person and never be complete without them. This is not a nuanced conclusion, and the heavy-handed conclusion is disappointing given the promising start.</p>

<p>I really liked the central motif (and title) of admission – obviously this refers to college admissions, but also to the admission or retention of secrets. The Latecomer did something similar. The title/central motif most obviously referred to the arrival of a fourth child many years after the birth of the first three (triplets), but also to people arriving or doing something too late.</p>

<p><em>Admission</em> was published in 2009, significantly before <em>The Latecomer</em> (2022) and <em>The Plot</em> (2021). And it reads like that too, like an earlier, less polished version of the writing style I so love in these later two books.</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently read Admission by Jean Hanff Korelitz.

The mark of a good book, in my opinion, is one that I know I will reread. Rereading is a weird thing, though – sometimes I reread a book and I love it so much more than I did initially (examples: <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>). Sometimes it’s more gradual, and each time I reread a book I like it more and more (examples: <em>The True Deceiver</em>, <em>Free Food for Millionaires</em>). But I’ve sometimes had the experience of rereading a book and liking it less than the first time or just feeling like the book didn’t live up to my memory of it. I felt this way recently about <em>Anne of the Island</em>, the third book in the Anne of Green Gables series. In the book, Anne leaves Prince Edward Island to go to college in Kingsport, Nova Scotia.  The book wasn’t as good as I remembered it being, and I also remembered some key scenes, scenes that were important to my overarching narrative of being A Reader as a child, flat-out wrong.</p>

<p>I had a vivid memory of a particular scene in <em>Anne of the Island</em>, and that’s the primary reason I decided to reread the book almost 15 years later. In my memory, Anne is dressed for a school dance and her friend Phillipa Gordon tells Anne that 9 times out of 10, Phillipa is the most beautiful girl in the room. But 10% of the time, Anne totally eclipses Phillipa, and right now is one of those times. Anne wears flowers that Gilbert (her childhood enemy-turned-friend and clearly who she’s destined to end up with) sent her to the dance, even though her fiance Roy Gardner (Anne’s romantic ideal of a guy, tall, handsome, and writes poetry to her but doesn’t get humor) also sent her flowers. Gilbert sees her at the dance in her all-eclipsing state and in that moment realizes that Anne loves him after all. They give each other looks of significance and everything is basically settled. I thought it was pretty much the most romantic thing that could happen to someone.</p>

<p>This isn’t how it actually happened, though. In reality, Phillipa’s comment about Anne totally eclipsing her comes way earlier in the book. It’s before a school dance and Gilbert sees Anne and is definitely in love with her, but at this point, Anne hasn’t turned Gilbert down for the first time so the moment doesn’t mean as much. Anne hasn’t even met Roy yet. In a much later scene, she does choose to wear Gilbert’s flowers over Roy’s, but it’s to her graduation. Gilbert sees her and feels feelings, but at that time Anne actually thinks that Gilbert is either engaged or about to become engaged to Christine, and she doesn’t fully acknowledge her love for him. In that moment, Anne is fully planning on accepting Roy when he proposes. (She doesn’t, though.) Reading these scenes for the second time and realizing that my memory wasn’t quite right made me sad. My version of events was part of the narrative I tell myself about how books have impacted me. It feels hollow to discover that one of these key memories didn’t even happen.</p>

<p>The book also just isn’t quite as good as I remember it being. The flowery descriptions that I thought were so sophisticated 15 years ago were just kind of annoying now. I still like Anne, but now I also think she’s a bit of a prig which is definitely not what I thought of her originally. It’s disconcerting to find that a book that was perfect as a kid is just not as good as an adult. It’s like <em>Anne of the Island</em> is actually two very distinct books, two different versions of the same story – one perfect book, which I read as a kid, and one just okay book that I read as an adult.</p>

<p>I loved the Anne of Green Gables series (and the 1985 movie), but I actually only read the first three books. And I distinctly remember why I stopped after the third book – Anne and Gilbert get engaged at the end of it, and that was the end of what was interesting to me as a 14 year old. To be 18 years old and in college and engaged was the height of interest to me at a 14 year old. I saw no need to continue with the rest of the series after reaching that peak. I wasn’t much interested in characters that were older than their early twenties. I should’ve stuck with it, though, because Anne and Gilbert’s children become the central narrators in later books.</p>

<p>I had a similar experience with the Penderwicks, a series that follows four sisters as they go on various adventures and cope with the death of their mother. I didn’t reread the books as an adult, but rather continued the series as an adult where I’d left off as a child. Book one of the series, <em>The Penderwicks: A Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy</em>, came out in 2005, but I didn’t start reading the series until at least 2010. The oldest sister, Rosalind, is 12 during that first book, and the youngest sister Batty (Elizabeth) is four. I’m not exactly sure when I first started reading the series, but I think I was 11 or 12 (so, 2007 or 2008) because I remember being just a little younger than Rosalind. I read the first book and the second, <em>The Penderwicks on Gardam Street</em> (2008) in quick succession.</p>

<p>Then, I got older. I didn’t realize that more Penderwicks books had come out (three more in fact, published between 2008 and 2018) until I was in college. I read books 3-5 when I was 23 after coming across them at The Strand during a work trip to New York City in 2019. Even though I wasn’t the target audience anymore, I enjoyed the books. But they didn’t hit the same as the first two books. I was particularly frustrated with the fifth book, <em>The Penderwicks at Last</em>. All of the books are third person omniscient, but rotate between the points of view of the four sisters (similar to Little Women) throughout the first four books.</p>

<p>But in the fifth book, the sisters have apparently grown too old to be the central characters of a children’s book. So, eleven-year-old Lydia, half sister to the original four and not even born until the third book, takes over. The books are for children and so it makes sense that the central character would always be a child or children. But I was most interested in the core four sisters, who are now young adults. When I read the first two books as a kid, I felt like I was growing up with the Penderwick sisters and experiencing similar trials and feelings as them. I spent a lot of time contemplating which sister I was most like.</p>

<p>The fifth book has a “back to the beginning” sort of feel, and not in a good way. I didn’t want to hear what a second grader thought about Batty finally getting together with Jeffery, especially when that second grader really cared more about Batty’s dog than the relationship. I wanted Batty’s perspective, the perspective I was used to from the rest of the books. It was less satisfying to hear about the resolution from a distant party than to not know how things resolved at all.</p>

<p>A lot of kids’ series do this – the series progresses, the central kid becomes an adult, and then the central character is replaced with a different kid. This happens in <em>Little Women</em> (Nat Blake is the central character of <em>Little Men</em>) and the Laura Ingalls Wilder series (Rose Wilder eventually replaces Laura), in addition to the Penderwicks and Anne of Green Gables. (And probably countless others.) As an adult, I want to know how Jo March runs her school, and how Laura raises her daughter. But that’s just not how it works because I’m no longer the target audience. Children’s books aren’t for me anymore. As Anne says to Paul in chapter 23 of <em>Anne of the Island</em>, “You must pay the penalty of growing up. You must leave fairyland behind.” I can visit fairyland, but I can never live there as I did when I was a kid.</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reread books a lot.

I think this embarrassment comes from a variety of places. Sally Rooney is a <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/sally-rooney-bucket-hat">super popular</a> author, and I sort of resent that I really like an author who a lot of other people like. I want to have more alternative, subtle taste in books! Her books are also pretty melodramatic. They’re all on-and-off relationships and lack of communication and existential crises. I like this angst, but I’m also a little ashamed that I like this angst – it feels like something I should have grown out of. Anyway, because I liked Sally Rooney’s first two books so much, I was really excited to hear she had a new book coming out – <em>Beautiful World, Where Are You</em>. I was so excited in fact, that I preordered the damn book back in June. (It came out in September.) I’ve never preordered a book in my life.</p>

<p>I read an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/12/unread-messages">excerpt of the book</a> a few months before it came out and was totally intrigued. I also read a ton of reviews in the months in between when I preordered the book and when I received it in the mail. Many reviewers commented on how the omniscient third person narration chapters are interspersed with first person narration chapters that consisted of “emails” between two characters. <a href="https://thesewaneereview.com/articles/beautiful-world-where-are-you">The Sewanee Review, for example, called the book “the most ambitious and least successful of Rooney’s novels”</a> because of this technique, but like other reviews, stopped short of absolutely condemning the technique. I absolutely condemn the technique – the rest of this article is my polemic on why I hated this artistic choice.</p>

<p>All of Sally Rooney’s books use emails in some form, and I actually liked them a lot in CwF and NP. The difference was that in CwF and NP, the emails (and text messages) were embedded in the normal, third-person narration. While this format is somewhat contrived, I thought it worked well and helped move the plot along. But it doesn’t work in <em>Beautiful World</em>. The email chapters in <em>Beautiful World</em> rehash the events of the previous third-person chapters. Because of rehashing, I thought the pace of the book really dragged – I felt like I was reading the same chapter twice, whereas I found CwF and NP intensely readable.</p>

<p>In addition, I thought that the email chapters somewhat paradoxically disconnected me from the characters. While the emails allowed me to get inside the heads of the characters to some extent, the ideas they expressed felt so generic and parroted that it was almost like negative character development. Conversely, the third-person chapters allowed me to actually get an understanding of who these people were. But as these chapters made up only about half of the book, the characters felt underbaked and distant.</p>

<p>In both CwF and NP, Rooney’s characters are earnest and sympathetic people who care deeply about the world, and are also very self-centered and don’t always know what they’re talking about. This is intentional on Rooney’s part, and she strikes a really great balance between the serious earnestness and the funny self-absorption. I totally saw this balance between earnestness and arrogance in a lot of people I knew in college, including myself. (I’d like to think I’m on my way to growing out of that arrogance!)</p>

<p>But I didn’t find this same balance or humor in <em>Beautiful World</em>. In fact, I finally found the distaste for Rooney’s characters in <em>Beautiful World</em> that a lot of reviewers had for her characters in CwF and NP. Is this because outside of an academic university context, these characters don’t make sense? Is it because they’re 30 instead of 20, so their musing just seem immature? I’m not sure. I’ve spent a really long time thinking about this, and I’ve found it hard to pinpoint the exact reasons for my distaste. The views of the <em>Beautiful World</em> characters seem less earnest and genuine than the views of NP and CwF. In addition, the chapters upon chapters of emails really expanded on these half-baked views – while the half-baked views really worked in moderation/as a supporting act in NP and CwF, they don’t stand up to the expanded, unironic treatment Rooney gives them in <em>Beautiful World</em>. The tension between personal and political angst seems trite in <em>Beautiful World</em>. It’s barely a tension, just people complaining that the tension exists. In NP and CwF, though, it’s a real tension. It’s not as explicit as <em>Beautiful World</em>, but it’s thoroughly woven into the story. That’s super cool.</p>

<p>For example, passages about emails and current events go like this in NP:</p>

<p>“At the moment, they’re both engrossed in the Edward Snowden story, Marianne because of her interest in the architecture of global surveillance, and Connell because of the fascinating personal drama. […] He and Marianne can only talk about it over email, using the same communication technologies they now  know are under surveillance, and it feels at times like the relationship has been captured in a complex network of state power, that the network is a form of intelligence in itself, containing them both, and containing their feelings for one another. I feel like the NSA agent reading these emails has the wrong impression of us, Marianne wrote once. They probably don’t know about the time you didn’t take me to the Debs.” (162-163)</p>

<p>The combination of the third-person description of the email with a snippet of something Marianne actually said in the email, and the whole scene is brief. It works.</p>

<p>In <em>Beautiful World</em>, a similar exchange takes longer, and is not funny:</p>

<p>“Alice, do you remember a few weeks or months ago I sent you an email about the Late Bronze Age collapse? I went on reading about it afterwards, and it seems that while little is known about the period, scholarly interpretations are more various than the Wikipedia page led me to believe. We do know that before the collapse, rich and literate palace economies in the Eastern Mediterranean readed in exorbitant costly goods, apparently sending and receiving them as gifts to and from rules of other kingdoms…” and on, and on, and on (168).</p>

<p>The first-person style of this exchange removes all the ironic distance that the similar NP scene had. It’s not as concise, not as snappy. And the characters are deadly serious – they aren’t able to see the ironic side of their interactions like the characters in NP are able to, and there’s no self-awareness. Maybe the characters, and maybe Rooney too, are just too tired and discouraged when confronted with the state of the world to be concise and ironic. I don’t blame them – it just doesn’t make particularly good fiction.</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a little bit embarrassed about how much I like Conversations with Friends and Normal People, the first two books by author Sally Rooney.

In anticipation of my move, I joined my Mountain View neighborhood’s <a href="https://buynothingproject.org/">Buy Nothing group</a> in order to offload some of the things that I didn’t want to pack up and move – things like clothes I no longer wore, books I read and didn’t like, some cheap IKEA furniture that I longer needed, and various items of an old roommate that I’d never gotten around to getting rid of. The Mountain View Buy Nothing group I joined was extremely active – multiple people expressed interest in almost everything I posted, and I was ultimately able to rehome a lot of items. I was surprised how great doing this felt – less profit driven than donating to Goodwill, more “useful” than bringing to the recycling center, more personal than posting on the free section of Craigslist, and more altruistic than selling on eBay (not that I could sell things like miscellaneous light bulbs anyway).</p>

<p>Then, I moved to San Mateo. As I unpacked my things, I found even more items that I wanted to get rid of. I joined the San Mateo Buy Nothing group and posted the following items: an unopened assorted popcorn gift kit; a small unopened bag of fancy dried fruit; a gently used but clean twin mattress protector; and two new, unopened water filters for a ZeroWater (sorta like a Brita) pitcher. If I had posted these back in Mountain View, I know without a doubt that most if not items would have gone quickly – definitely within the hour and with “multiple interest” (to use the group’s terminology). But here in the San Mateo group (which is, interestingly, much larger than the Mountain View group) –  silence. Well, mostly. The popcorn kit went in less than 30 minutes, with 2-3 people interested in it. The fruit went a few hours later. And nothing else went.</p>

<p>I posted the rest of the items on Craigslist’s free section. The mattress pad and water filters went very quickly, as did a lot of lesser quality items like a swiffer with no pad (I couldn’t believe someone actually wanted this!) and a strand of twinkle lights with some bulbs out.</p>

<p>This played out the same way the few other times I posted something on the Buy Nothing San Mateo group – I posted, nobody was interested, so I offloaded the items on Craigslist’s free section. The items I was trying to give away weren’t crappy or anything, either – they went pretty quickly on Craigslist.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the San Mateo Buy Nothing group isn’t active at all – it is, but mainly for food (“I have leftover cupcakes from a specialty bakery”) and really nice, larger items (“I have a pop up soccer net that’s brand new” or “here’s an iPad I no longer use.”). The Mountain View one skewed toward smaller, lower-priced items. For example, I posted a random assortment of miscellaneous loose lightbulbs, and got “multiple interest” almost immediately.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I think it has something to do with socioeconomic diversity – the San Mateo group I’m in now doesn’t seem to have much, while the Mountain View group seemed to have a lot more. The area I lived in in Mountain View (that is, the area encompassed in the Buy Nothing group) consisted primarily of small older apartment complexes, newer row houses, older ranch style single-family homes, and a trailer park. In contrast, North San Mateo (where I now live) primarily includes single family homes that are significantly more expensive than the single family homes in my old Mountain View neighborhood, along with a smattering of apartment complexes that are, overall, nicer and more expensive than the complex I lived in in Mountain View.</p>

<p>This is all to say, I’m nostalgic for my old Buy Nothing group. I missed being able to post a giant, half-used canister of laundry detergent that my old roommate left behind and within the hour, be able to gift it to a woman who’s been doing a lot of laundry because her young son keeps peeing his pants. It felt genuinely good to be able to offload some sweaters that I didn’t wear much anymore to other women who told me how much they loved them after picking them up, as opposed to selling them on eBay or Poshmark. (Which I’ve also done – but that’s a story for a different article!)</p>

<p>That’s not to say there’s not a lot of positive stuff going on in the San Mateo Buy Nothing group – for example, there’s a woman who makes literal gallons of soup every few weeks, just to be able to give them away to members of the group. And I noticed what could possibly be hoarding tendencies more often on the Mountain View group – that is, people who commented on multiple posts a day. But still, it seemed to me that in Mountain View, goods were actually getting meaningfully redistributed from people who didn’t want or need something anymore to neighbors who wanted or needed that very thing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved from Mountain View to San Mateo at the end of March. In anticipation of my move, I joined my Mountain View neighborhood’s Buy Nothing group in order to offload some of the things that I didn’t want to pack up and move – things like clothes I no longer wore, books I read and didn’t like, some cheap IKEA furniture that I longer needed, and various items of an old roommate that I’d never gotten around to getting rid of. The Mountain View Buy Nothing group I joined was extremely active – multiple people expressed interest in almost everything I posted, and I was ultimately able to rehome a lot of items.

<h1 id="1-the-country-of-the-pointed-firs-and-other-stories-by-sarah-orne-jewett">#1: <em>The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories</em> by Sarah Orne Jewett</h1>

<p>This book is a novella (<em>The Country of the Pointed Firs</em>) and a collection of short stories. Every story in the book takes place on the coast of Maine in the late 1800s. With a few exceptions, the stories are almost all about widowed or single women above the age of 50. There’s not much drama or even plot – the stories are about everyday life and the conversations the main characters have with their friends and neighbors. It was a really nice read.</p>

<h1 id="2-brooklyn-by-colm-toibin">#2: <em>Brooklyn</em> by Colm Toibin</h1>

<p><em>Brooklyn</em> is an old favorite that I’ve read multiple times before. Eilis’s ambivalence around many of the decisions she makes really struck me this time, as did her commitment to love despite that ambivalence.</p>

<h1 id="3-conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney">#3: <em>Conversations with Friends</em> by Sally Rooney</h1>

<p>I read this book, for the third time, in anticipation of the miniseries that’s coming out in a few weeks. I liked it just alright this time around. I found myself getting much more annoyed at with the characters and their lack of communication this read. Does this just mean I’m getting older?</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[…in chronological order.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The books I read in December 2021</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/27/booksdecember.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The books I read in December 2021" /><published>2021-12-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/27/booksdecember</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/27/booksdecember.html"><![CDATA[<p>…in chronological order.</p>

<h1 id="1-artificial-condition-by-martha-wells">#1: <em>Artificial Condition</em> by Martha Wells</h1>

<p>This is the second book in the Murderbot series by Martha Wells. I love the Murderbot books! They’re quick stories (around 150 pages) with pace that are extremely fun to read. One thing I like about these books is the tight focus on plot. There’s world building going on here, but it’s only in service of the plot. A reader gets a glimpse into this new world, but doesn’t get major backstories or understand really how this world relates to our current world (a lot of science fiction explicitly makes this kind of connection). I like this, and it’s especially helpful in keeping the short book tight and focused. I love the snarky tone of the books, too.</p>

<h1 id="2-the-tenant-of-wildfell-hall-by-anne-bronte">#2: <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> by Anne Bronte</h1>

<p>After taking a break from Murderbot, I jumped back into the Brontes! I liked this book and enjoyed the layered narration style that’s similar to the narration style of Wuthering Heights. Though, I found Gilbert Markham to be a rather disappointing love interest. He seemed just way overdramatic, especially compared with the very principled and grounded Helen.</p>

<p>The <em>Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> is apparently one of the very first feminist novels – May Sinclair <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/29/classics.gender">said</a>, “the slamming of [Helen’s] bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England.”</p>

<p>Anne died (at age 29) shortly after the publication of <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em>. Charlotte subsequently prevented republication of the book because she thought it was a distasteful novel. (She let <em>Agnes Grey</em> be republished, though.) That’s one of the reasons why <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> has never been as popular as other Bronte books. Damn it, Charlotte!!!</p>

<h1 id="3-convenience-store-woman-by-sayaka-murata">#3: <em>Convenience Store Woman</em> by Sayaka Murata</h1>

<p>I received this was a totally wacky book as a birthday gift, and I loved it! I thought that the main character, Keiko, was rather unbelievable, but I think that was sort of the point? The book was about the pressure individuals (especially women) feel to meet society’s standards, especially standards around getting married, having children, and choosing a career.</p>

<p>Society’s rules are regressive and arbitrary. With this assumption in mind, the book then asks, why is it more weird for someone to be thoroughly in tune with a convenience store than thoroughly in tune with society? If anything, the latter case is more logical.</p>

<p>I thought the overall vibe of the book had some similarities to <em>Severance</em>. (Both wacky commentaries on capitalism and dysfunctional society.)</p>

<h1 id="4-such-a-fun-age-by-kiley-reid">#4: <em>Such a Fun Age</em> by Kiley Reid</h1>

<p>Constrained once again to my e-book while traveling for the holidays, I decided to read <em>Such a Fun Age</em>, a book I’ve been aware of for awhile.</p>

<p>This book was compelling and fun to read, but overall I found the writing inconsistent – really engaging at times, and rather clunky and full of unnecessary detail at other times. The story was good, if a bit clunky, and it was one of the few books where I thought that alternating perspectives from different characters actually worked. Usually I don’t like this narrative style.</p>

<h1 id="5-giovannis-room-by-james-baldwin">#5: <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> by James Baldwin</h1>

<p><em>Giovanni’s Room</em> is book I’ve been meaning to read for a long time, though I forget where I first read about it or who recommended it to me. This is the first book by James Baldwin that I’ve read. I’d like to read <em>Go Tell It On the Mountain</em>. Baldwin’s writing style gave me some Hemingway vibes. (I recently read <em>A Moveable Feast</em>.)</p>

<p>In Giovanni’s Room, all the characters are white. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-unsparing-confessions-of-giovannis-room">Baldwin didn’t want to tackle two major issues (race and sexuality) at once, saying</a>:</p>

<p>“I certainly could not possibly have—not at that point in my life—handled the other great weight, the ‘Negro problem.’ The sexual-moral light was a hard thing to deal with. I could not handle both propositions in the same book. There was no room for it,” he said.</p>

<p>I find both Hemingway and Baldwin a bit hard to read at times. While each sentence by itself is easy enough, the sentences are so dense and packed and sometimes rely on assumptions between them that I feel like it take a lot of thought to read – you want to get everything! It was a bit hard for me to get into <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> at first, but I soon became engrossed. I especially liked how Baldwin wrote about David’s similar and conflicting feelings for Hella and Giovanni.</p>

<h1 id="6-minor-feelings-by-cathy-park-hong">#6: <em>Minor Feelings</em> by Cathy Park Hong</h1>

<p>I read half of this book about a year ago, but stopped when it was due at the library. I finally started <em>Minor Feelings</em> over and read it in its entirety. I really liked parts of this book (I loved the chapter about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_Hak_Kyung_Cha">Theresa Cha</a>), but overall, too many references to Twitter – and so many references overall – bogged me down. The narrative style was unconventional and very artistic, but maybe I’m not artistic enough to fully get it!</p>]]></content><author><name>Devin Logan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[…in chronological order.]]></summary></entry></feed>
