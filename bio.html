<div class="content"> I have development experience with Python and Java and am comfortable both reading and creating source code in those languages. I have working experience with HTML and CSS (which I used to make this website!). I have used XML and DITA principles in a technical writing context. I also have academic experience with LaTeX.
</div>


<div class="content3">I've also worked with a lot of tools. On the development side, I'm familiar with Android Studio, Eclipse, GitHub, and Subversion. On the tech writing side, I've worked with Oxygen XML Editor, Microsoft Visio, Snagit, JIRA, Bugzilla, and version control principles (GitHub). I am also experienced with content management systems (particularly Cascade CMS) and SEO principles.
