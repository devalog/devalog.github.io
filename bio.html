        <p>        
        I'm very comfortable developing and documenting code in Java and Python. I'm less comfortable, but still familiar, with C and C++. I've used XML and DITA to create and edit technical documentation. I have working knowledge of HTML and CSS, which I used to build this website.

        I'm familiar with a number of different tools. On the development side, I've worked with Android Studio, Eclipse, GitHub, and Subversion. On the documentation side, I've worked with Oxygen XML Editor, Microsoft Visio, Snagit, JIRA, Bugzilla, and GitHub. I'm also comfortable in a UNIX environment.

        I'm not currently looking for a job (I'm very excited to be starting with Google in a few months), but I'd still love to talk with you if you're interested in my background!
