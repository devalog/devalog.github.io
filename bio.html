<p style="width:50%;">I am currently a student at <a href="http://www.wm.edu/">The College of William & Mary</a> in Williamsburg, Virginia. I am a double major in English and Accounting, and I am completing the coursework for a Computer Science minor (my school does not let students formally declare a double major and a minor). I am hoping to pursue technical writing after graduation, as I think technical writing combines my writing ability and proclivity with my technical skills and interest in software. After graduation, I hope to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, or Washington, D.C. (depending, of course, on where I get a job). </p>
  
 <p style="width:50%;">With these goals, it may seem strange to see that I am, along with my English and Computer Science coursework, an Accounting major. Let me explain. I originally chose Accounting because I liked the logic and meticulous puzzle-nature of solving accounting problems. I still really, really enjoy my accounting coursework. However, after an enlightening internship with a small tax company, I realized that while I like accounting in theory, I do not enjoy it in practice. I proceeded to switch my focus to technical writing: Iâ€™ve always liked writing, and technical writing combined writing and technology in a way that let me combine creativity with meticulous problem-solving skills that initially drew me toward accounting. A really great internship with <a href="https://mapr.com/">MapR Technologies</a> in the summer of 2017 confirmed this switch, and now I am actively searching for a technical writing position (I am looking to start sometime in the summer of 2018).</p>
