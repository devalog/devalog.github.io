     <h1>Using tables in technical documentation</h1>
        <br>
        <p>People read technical docs for a variety of reasons. These reasons can be broken down into two very broad categories:
        <ul>
        <li>Reading to learn.</li>
        <li>Reading to get something done.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>Users who are reading to learn are typically okay with reading paragraphs. They might want a general overview about a new topic or a refresher on a topic they haven’t thought about in a long time. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>Users who are reading to get something done typically skim technical documents, looking for the specific piece of information they want. These users might want instructions on how to complete a task or decision criteria. Often, these users don’t have time to read paragraphs. They want something else. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>
        A lot of people use lists for non-overview material. This is a good thing: lists break up text and make your content more scannable for users. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>When to use tables instead of lists</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Lists are good, especially when the list content is just doing one thing. For example, you might want to just list various use cases:</p>
         <p>“You can use System A in the following use cases:
        <ul>
        <li>Use case 1</li>
        <li>Use case 2</li>
        <li>Use case 3"</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
       <p>Sometimes, though, tables can be an even better choice than lists.</p>
        <br>
       <p>If you’re trying to do multiple things in a single list (for example, you might want to list different use cases and also describe which implementation approach to take for each use case), you might consider using a table instead to make your content more scannable and easier to digest.</p>
 <br>
      <p>For example, say you have a system that users can interact with in various ways depending on what they want to do. Putting this information in a list might look something like the following:</p>
  <br>
      <p>“Use the following list to determine how to integrate with System A according to your use case:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>If you want to use case 1, integrate with System A in way 1</li>
        <li>If you want to use case 2, integrate with System A in way 2</li>
        <li>If you want to use case 3, integrate with System A in way 3"</li>
       </ul>
 <br>
       <p>This list splits up the information and makes it scannable. However, there’s still quite a lot of repeated text in this short list. While the repeated text really isn’t a problem in such a short list, it could really bulk up the list if you needed to add additional things to each bullet point (for example, benefits, drawbacks, and links to integration instructions.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>Using a table could reduce some of this repetition. Putting the same information from above in a table might look something like the following:</p>
 <br>
 <p>“Use the following table to determine how to use System A according to your use case:</p>
 <br>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <th>If you want to...</th>
   <th>Integrate with System A in...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use case 1</td>
   <td>Way 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use case 2</td>
   <td>Way 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Use case 3</td>
   <td>Way 3</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
