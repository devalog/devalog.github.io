        <p>People read technical docs for a variety of reasons. These reasons can be broken down into two very broad categories:
        <ul>
        <li>Reading to learn.</li>
        <li>Reading to get something done.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Users who are reading to learn are typically okay with reading paragraphs. They might want a general overview about a new topic or a refresher on a topic they haven’t thought about in a long time. 
        </p>
        <p>Users who are reading to get something done typically skim technical documents, looking for the specific piece of information they want. These users might want instructions on how to complete a task or decision criteria. Often, these users don’t have time to read paragraphs. They want something else. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A lot of people use lists for non-overview material. This is a good thing: lists break up text and make your content more scannable for users. 
        </p>
        <h2>When to use tables instead of lists</h2>
        <p>Lists are good, especially when the list content is just doing one thing. For example, you might want to just list various use cases: “You can use System A in the following use cases:
        <ul>
        <li>Use case 1</li>
        <li>Use case 2</li>
        <li>Use case 3</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
