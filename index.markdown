I write about technical things for technical and nontechnical audiences. More specifically, I:

*   Write end user documentation, including conceptual overviews, reference documentation, API guides, and codelabs.
*   Write technical content that bridges marketing and documentation needs, like case studies, blog posts, and product specs.
*   Create training materials like education modules or presentations.
*   Edit, expand, or reconfigure technical material.
*   Design comprehensive documentation strategies

Skills I have:

*   Markdown, HTML, CSS, GitHub, docs-as-code, static site generators (Jekyll, Fern).
*   Testing developer workflows
*   Working with minimal supervision, either autonomously or as part of a team. 
*   Learning new information and new technologies quickly.
*   Using AI as a tool for coding and writing.
