## About me

I'm currently a technical writer at [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/). I write developer documentation and technical marketing content for all of Fern's products (Docs, SDKs, AI search). Previously, I was a technical writer at Google for 6.5 years. Before that, I was a technical writer intern at MapR Technologies (acquired by HP). I went to the College of William and Mary, where I double-majored in English and Accounting and minored in Computer Science.
