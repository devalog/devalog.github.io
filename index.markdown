I write about technical things for technical and nontechnical audiences. More specifically, I:

*   Write end user documentation, including conceptual overviews, reference documentation, API guides, and codelabs.
*   Write technical content that bridges marketing and documentation needs, like case studies, blog posts, and product specs.
*   Create training materials like education modules or presentations.
*   Edit, expand, or reconfigure technical material.
*   Develop documentation and maintenance strategies.

Skills I have:

*   Markdown, HTML, CSS, GitHub, docs-as-code, static site generators (Jekyll, Fern).
*   Testing developer workflows
*   Working with minimal supervision, either autonomously or as part of a team. 
*   Learning new information and new technologies quickly.
*   Documenting Python, Java, and C++ code.
*   Using AI as a tool for coding and writing.
*   Using and learning new technical writing tools, including Microsoft Office and Google Workspace suites, version control tools, Oxygen XML, etc. 

Recent projects:

*   SDK docs for [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/) (current).
*   Walk-through videos and docs consulting for Class Constructor Corp.
*   Payment processing docs for Dowling Community Garden
