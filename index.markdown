I write about technical things for technical or nontechnical audiences. More specifically, I:

*   Write end user documentation, including conceptual overviews, reference documentation, API guides, and codelabs.
*   Write technical content that bridges marketing and documentation needs, like case studies, blog posts, and product specs.
*   Create training materials like education modules or presentations.
*   Edit, expand, or reconfigure technical material.
*   Develop documentation and maintenance strategies.

Skills I have:

*   Writing HTML and Markdown. I'm also an expert in editing and writing hacky CSS:)
*   Working with minimal supervision, either automously or as part of a team. 
*   Learning new information and new technologies quicklys.
*   Documenting Python, Java, and C++ code.
*   Using AI as a tool for coding and writing.
*   Using and learning new technical writing tools, including Microsoft Office and Google Workspace suites, version control tools, Oxygen XML, etc. 


I'm currently open for freelance work, especially part-time or ad-hoc work. I'm also open to doing documentation work at a reduced rate for nonprofits or personal projects. Reach out if you're interested!
