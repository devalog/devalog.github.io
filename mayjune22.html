      <h1>Some thoughts about the books I read in May and June 2022</h1>

      <br>

<p>The worst book I read recently was <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i>, which provoked a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Penguin_Books_Ltd">landmark obscenity trial</a> in the UK in 1960. Some critics think D.H. Lawrence’s writing style was influenced by his tuberculosis, which he died from two years after publishing <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>. Apparently, tuberculosis can cause a heightened emotional state and also impotence, which matches up pretty well to my personal beef with the book: I found the prose insufferably flowery and the characters flat and annoying. </p>
<br>
<p>The best book I read recently was probably <i>Passing</i> by Nella Larsen. The book was so tense and readable and concise. <i>Klara and the Sun</i> was good too – I like speculative fiction that has disorienting, unobtrusive world-building, where the reader has to figure out over the course of many pages how exactly the setting relates to present-day Earth. <i>Klara and the Sun</i> did that really well. </p>
